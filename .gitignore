# I think .idea/libraries files should be included if the project is
# not dependent on another project or module. If, however, the project
# is dependent on a module that contains the libraries, then this
# file should be ignored at the project level, but not by the module.
# If the project is Maven or Gradle based and these library files are
# generated automatically on import, you can exclude them from the version control.
#  When the libraries are configured manually by the user, they should be shared.
